## Problem 5: This problem was asked by Twitter

A permutation can be specified by an array P, where P[i] represents the location of the element at i in the permutation.
For example, **[2, 1, 0]** represents the permutation where elements at the index **0** and **2** are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. For example, given the array **["a", "b", "c"]** and 
the permutation **[2, 1, 0]**, return **["c", "b", "a"]**.

**Output**

Unit tests code were implemented using "Pytest". Run the following command to check that the code pass the different tests or modify the file to customize it according to your necessities.

```
C:\>pytsest Problem5_test.py

```
The output when  you run it on the terminal is:
