## Problem 1: This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given **[10, 15, 3, 7]** and k of **17**, return **true since 10 + 7 is 17**.

### Output
For this example: The numbers added to the list are introduced by the user and it considers a maximum amount of 4 numbers.

Considering as reference the example that the question specifies, the output when you running on the terminal is:

```
C:\>python Problem1.py
Please enter a number:10
Please enter a number:15
Please enter a number:3
Please enter a number:7
Your list of numbers is:
[3, 7, 10, 15]
Enter a number for the k value:17
The two numbers from the list that add up k are: (7, 10)

```
