## Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Answer: 4613732**

To solve the problem the following recursion relation was taken in account:

*Even_Fn = 4(Even_Fn-1) + Even_Fn-2*

and as seed or initial values: 

```
even_f0 = 0          
even_f1 = 2
```

The driver function generates the following output:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":  # Driver function
    limit_ex = 4000000
    print("The total sum of all the even terms in the Fibonacci sequence no higher than 4,000,000 is:",
          fiboeven(limit_ex))
```
**Output:**

The total sum of all the even terms in the Fibonacci sequence no higher than 4,000,000 is: 4613732
