## Solutions to different Coding Exercises/Challenges 

The goal of the repository is to provide proposals to the exercises of the following websites that contain a wide range portfolio. The code can be always be improved. If you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to open a *pull request or issue*.
In a near future, I intend to implement the answers as well in JAVA.
 
[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com)

The creators describe their project as a technical interview prep service that sends an interview coding problem every day. The service is provided directly to your email once you subscribed. 
An interview that describes in depth the initial idea, development, current growing and revenue can be found in the following link:

[Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)

It is a well-known Website dedicated to a series of computational problems. It was created in 2001 by Colin Hughes. The current portfolio covers a total of *633* problems. 
The implementation can be made in any programming language, but according to the current statistics of the website, the most popular languages are:

Total amount of members:  **821,637** registered who have solved at least one problem.

1. Python: 50,150 members
2. C/C++ : 42,747 members
