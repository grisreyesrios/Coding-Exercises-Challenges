## Solutions to different Coding Exercises/Challenges 

Learning to program means to analyze a problem, find a solution and implement it using a programming language. The goal of the repository is to provide proposals to the exercises of the following websites that contain a wide range portfolio.
 
[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com)]

The creators describe their project as a technical interview prep service that sends an interview coding problem every day. The service is provided directly to your email once you subscribed. 
An interview that describes in depth the initial idea, development, current growing and revenue can be found in the following link:

[Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)]

It is a well-known Website dedicated to a series of computational problems. It was created in 2001 by Colin Hughes. The current portfolio covers a total of 633 problems.  Every member can achieve a total of 24 levels that it is reached every 25  exercises that are solved.

The implementation can be made in any programming language, but according to the current statistics of the website, the most popular languages are:

Total amount of members:  **821637** registeredwho have solved at least one problem.

1. Python: 50,150 members
2. C/C++ : 42,747 members
3. JAVA: 28,938 members
4. C# : 13,487 members
5. Haskell: 6, 782 members

Solutions using Python 3.7.0, Atom and PyCharm (IDE for Python).
